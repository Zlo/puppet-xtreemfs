# [*dir_host*]
#     Provide an host to where metadata and storage nodes will be connecting, 
#     defaults: <tt>$::fqdn</tt>
# [*dir_port*]
#     (Optional) A port for directory service connection
# [*dir_protocol*]
#     (Optional) A protocol for directory service connection
# [*atboot*]
#     Should this mount be active also at boot time? If +true+, it will be
